                    <h3>About</h3>
                    <p>
                        This game is about tactical battles with enemies. Several scenarios available, one of which is selected
                        by random on each game start. If you win the game, you are awarded score points based on remaining characters,
                        their relative healthiness and spent rounds (round is when all characters have made a move).
                    </p>
                    <h3>Characters</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are 11 characters available in game (though not all of them are controlled by player in scenarios).
                    </p>

                            <p>
                                Warrior is the most basic and versatile of all characters.
                                Warrior has good melee damage, good armor, speed and initiative, but each of these stats is not the best among all
                                characters.
                            </p>

                                Spearman is armored character with reach attack.
                                He can do a lot of damage to enemies with his spear over one cell, but struggles to
                                hurt enemies in close combat.

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                Archer has the best range in game (almost whole field), but his damage is not very impressive.
                                In melee he deals miniscule amounts of damage, usually too little to pierce armor.
                                He can use great speed and initiative to maintain distance with enemies.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Healer can target her allies instead of enemies. If she attacks her ally, the ally restores some hp.
                                She can hit enemies too, but struggles to deal any damage to armored foes.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Elf-mage can use powerfull spells to deal with hordes of enemies.
                                When he has enough mp, his ranged attack become fireballs, dealing huge damage
                                to all targets in 3x3 area centered on target. His melee attack becomes force push and teleports affected enemy to
                                random cell (damage is calculated as if it was a basic ranged attack). He also negated some received damage with
                                force shield.
                                When Elf spends all his mp, he is quite weak.

                                Amazon is fast and furious warrior. She deals less damage than warrior, but inflicts it to all
                                enemies around her.
                                She also has great speed and initiative.

                            <p>
                                Orc is unarmored and initially deals small damage. Howether he deals more damage with every hit he
                                inflicts or receives, eventually reaching damage rating enough to one-shot any enemy.
                                He also has a bit more health than other melee characters (except Troll).

                                Goblin is small and agile warrior. He has little armor and inflicts small damage, but can
                                reach his target faster than any other class. He also has the best initiative, meaning he always does the first
                                attack.

                            <p>
                                Ghost is a magical creature, requiring mp to exist. It spends mp to move and attack, and dies when no mp is left.
                                It can also negate all damage with some chance (spending some mp). Its armor rating is good, and all other parameters
                                are not bad either.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Troll is the biggest and toughest of all characters. He regenerates some hp at start of his turn and has
                                a lot of hp to begin with. He also has the best armor and damage.
                                On the other hand he is very slow and often moves after all other characters, so ranged characters can
                                kill him quite easily.

                                Pirate is ranged character with a very powerful attack. His pistol has less range than archer's bow,
                                but deals a ton of damage. He has to reload after every shot, though, effectively skipping every other attack.
